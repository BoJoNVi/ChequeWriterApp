> Added logic when closing the application in Setup Activity Page
  - If Android Level API 1 to 20(Kitkat 4.4.4) then use the Old supported code [ ActivityCompat.finishAffinity(this) ]
    Else , when Level API is more than 20, then use the new supported code [ finishAndRemoveTask() ]
    // In this way, it will prevent runtime errors.
> The application is supported from Android API level 21 (Lollipop 5.0) to latest Android 11
> Stable build between Android 9 and 10 with 6.3" of Screen Resolution Display
